# Description

Avery's Organics is a mid-sized farm in Northern Oregon that grows organic produce and sells it at farmers markets throughout town. Since Avery's is at a different market almost every day, this website is to show customers which market they will be at on a given day.

Avery's also grows different crops in different seasons. This application will display what produce is available during which months on their site too.

We will use local state to toggle between days of the week.
